# Assignment1
1. Write a python program for the following:
– Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the
resultant string and print it.
Sample input:
•python
•Sample output:
•ntyp
SOLUTION: * In this program the user enters the sentance which is include with python word
          * Converting string to lowercase by using lower() function
          * Then used a "replace" function inorder to replace the "python" with "pythons" and stored it in string variable.
          * Then displayed the sentance after the replacement with pythons...

           Enter the sentance I love python and I work on PYTHON
           The sentance after replacing   i love pythons and i work on pythons 
  
– Take two numbers from user and perform at least 4 arithmetic operations on them.

SOLUTION: * Getting two integers from user inorder to perform  the arithmetic operations
          * Performed addition, substractio, multiplication, division and then displayed those values

        Enter 1st integer5
        Enter 2nd integer2
        The addition of 2 values is 7
        The multiplication of 2 values is 10
        The substraction of 2 values is 3
        The division of 2 values is 2.5

2. Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’.
•Sample input:
•I love playing with python
•Sample output:
•I love playing with pythons

SOLUTION: * Getting a word as input from user
          * Then deleting 2 characters from a word using :
          * Then reversing the resultant string by using the slice operator
          * Then displaying the final reversed string

        Enter string goodday
        The reversed string after removal of 2 characters ddoog 
       
 3. Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use
the grading scheme we are using in this class.

SOLUTION: * Getting an percentage from user.
          * Based on percentage calculating the grade
          * If grade is greater than or equals to 90 and less than or equals to 100 then grade is A
          * If grade is greater than or equals to 80 and less than 90 then grade is B
          * If grade is greater than or equals to 70 and less than 80 then grade is C
          * If grade is greater than or equals to 60 and less than 70 then grade is D
          * If grade is greater than or equals to 0 and less than 60 then grade is F

         Enter your percentage59.5
         Your grade is F
        PS C:\Users\pothu\OneDrive\Documents\Divya> & "C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" c:/Users/pothu/OneDrive/Documents/Divya/grades.py
        Enter your percentage80
        Your grade is B
        PS C:\Users\pothu\OneDrive\Documents\Divya> & "C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" c:/Users/pothu/OneDrive/Documents/Divya/grades.py
        Enter your percentage71.2
       Your grade is C
